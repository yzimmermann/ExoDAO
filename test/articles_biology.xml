            <title>Cell wall dynamics stabilize tip growth in a filamentous fungus</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001981</link>

Hyphal tip growth allows filamentous fungi to colonize space, reproduce, or infect. It features remarkable morphogenetic plasticity including unusually fast elongation rates, tip turning, branching, or bulging. These shape changes are all driven from the expansion of a protective cell wall (CW) secreted from apical pools of exocytic vesicles. How CW secretion, remodeling, and deformation are modulated in concert to support rapid tip growth and morphogenesis while ensuring surface integrity remains poorly understood. We implemented subresolution imaging to map the dynamics of CW thickness and secretory vesicles in &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus nidulans&lt;/i&gt;. We found that tip growth is associated with balanced rates of CW secretion and expansion, which limit temporal fluctuations in CW thickness, elongation speed, and vesicle amount, to less than 10% to 20%. Affecting this balance through modulations of growth or trafficking yield to near-immediate changes in CW thickness, mechanics, and shape. We developed a model with mechanical feedback that accounts for steady states of hyphal growth as well as rapid adaptation of CW mechanics and vesicle recruitment to different perturbations. These data provide unprecedented details on how CW dynamics emerges from material secretion and expansion, to stabilize fungal tip growth as well as promote its morphogenetic plasticity.</description>

            <title>Saccades are locked to the phase of alpha oscillations during natural reading</title>

We saccade 3 to 5 times per second when reading. However, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms coordinating the oculomotor and visual system during such rapid processing. Here, we ask if brain oscillations play a role in the temporal coordination of the visuomotor integration. We simultaneously acquired MEG and eye-tracking data while participants read sentences silently. Every sentence was embedded with a target word of either high or low lexical frequency. Our key finding demonstrated that saccade onsets were locked to the phase of alpha oscillations (8 to 13 Hz), and in particular, for saccades towards low frequency words. Source modelling demonstrated that the alpha oscillations to which the saccades were locked, were generated in the right-visual motor cortex (BA 7). Our findings suggest that the alpha oscillations serve to time the processing between the oculomotor and visual systems during natural reading, and that this coordination becomes more pronounced for demanding words.</description>

            <title>Combined modelling of mRNA decay dynamics and single-molecule imaging in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo uncovers a role for P-bodies in 5&#8242; to 3&#8242; degradation</title>

Regulation of mRNA degradation is critical for a diverse array of cellular processes and developmental cell fate decisions. Many methods for determining mRNA half-lives rely on transcriptional inhibition or metabolic labelling. Here, we use a non-invasive method for estimating half-lives for hundreds of mRNAs in the early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo. This approach uses the intronic and exonic reads from a total RNA-seq time series and Gaussian process regression to model the dynamics of premature and mature mRNAs. We show how regulation of mRNA stability is used to establish a range of mature mRNA dynamics during embryogenesis, despite shared transcription profiles. Using single-molecule imaging, we provide evidence that, for the mRNAs tested, there is a correlation between short half-life and mRNA association with P-bodies. Moreover, we detect an enrichment of mRNA 3&#8242; ends in P-bodies in the early embryo, consistent with 5&#8242; to 3&#8242; degradation occurring in P-bodies for at least a subset of mRNAs. We discuss our findings in relation to recently published data suggesting that the primary function of P-bodies in other biological contexts is mRNA storage.</description>

            <title>Structural basis of ferroportin inhibition by minihepcidin PR73</title>

Ferroportin (Fpn) is the only known iron exporter in humans and is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis. Fpn activity is suppressed by hepcidin, an endogenous peptide hormone, which inhibits iron export and promotes endocytosis of Fpn. Hepcidin deficiency leads to hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemia. Previous studies have shown that small peptides that mimic the first few residues of hepcidin, i.e., minihepcidins, are more potent than hepcidin. However, the mechanism of enhanced inhibition by minihepcidins remains unclear. Here, we report the structure of human ferroportin in complex with a minihepcidin, PR73 that mimics the first 9 residues of hepcidin, at 2.7 &#197; overall resolution. The structure reveals novel interactions that were not present between Fpn and hepcidin. We validate PR73-Fpn interactions through binding and transport assays. These results provide insights into how minihepcidins increase inhibition potency and will guide future development of Fpn inhibitors.</description>

            <title>Open hardware: From DIY trend to global transformation in access to laboratory equipment</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001931</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Wenzel&lt;/p&gt;

Open hardware solutions are increasingly being chosen by researchers as a strategy to improve access to technology for cutting-edge biology research. The use of DIY technology is already widespread, particularly in countries with limited access to science funding, and is catalyzing the development of open-source technologies. Beyond financial accessibility, open hardware can be transformational for the access of laboratories to equipment by reducing dependence on import logistics and enabling direct knowledge transfer. Central drivers to the adoption of appropriate open-source technologies in biology laboratories around the world are open sharing, digital fabrication, local production, the use of standard parts, and detailed documentation. This Essay examines the global spread of open hardware and discusses which kinds of open-source technologies are the most beneficial in scientific environments with economic and infrastructural constraints.</description>

            <title>The LHX2-OTX2 transcriptional regulatory module controls retinal pigmented epithelium differentiation and underlies genetic risk for age-related macular degeneration</title>

Tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) control the transcriptome through an association with noncoding regulatory regions (cistromes). Identifying the combination of TFs that dictate specific cell fate, their specific cistromes and examining their involvement in complex human traits remain a major challenge. Here, we focus on the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), an essential lineage for retinal development and function and the primary tissue affected in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness. By combining mechanistic findings in stem-cell-derived human RPE, in vivo functional studies in mice and global transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we revealed that the key developmental TFs LHX2 and OTX2 function together in transcriptional module containing LDB1 and SWI/SNF (BAF) to regulate the RPE transcriptome. Importantly, the intersection between the identified LHX2-OTX2 cistrome with published expression quantitative trait loci, ATAC-seq data from human RPE, and AMD genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, followed by functional validation using a reporter assay, revealed a causal genetic variant that affects AMD risk by altering &lt;i&gt;TRPM1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the RPE through modulation of LHX2 transcriptional activity on its promoter. Taken together, the reported cistrome of LHX2 and OTX2, the identified downstream genes and interacting co-factors reveal the RPE transcription module and uncover a causal regulatory risk single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the multifactorial common blinding disease AMD.</description>

            <title>Type II taste cells participate in mucosal immune surveillance</title>

The oral microbiome is second only to its intestinal counterpart in diversity and abundance, but its effects on taste cells remains largely unexplored. Using single-cell RNASeq, we found that mouse taste cells, in particular, sweet and umami receptor cells that express taste 1 receptor member 3 (&lt;i&gt;Tas1r3&lt;/i&gt;), have a gene expression signature reminiscent of Microfold (M) cells, a central player in immune surveillance in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as those in the Peyer&#8217;s patch and tonsils. Administration of tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11; also known as RANKL), a growth factor required for differentiation of M cells, dramatically increased M cell proliferation and marker gene expression in the taste papillae and in cultured taste organoids from wild-type (WT) mice. Taste papillae and organoids from knockout mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, a RANKL-regulated transcription factor required for M cell development and regeneration on the other hand, failed to respond to RANKL. Taste papillae from &lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice also showed reduced expression of NF-&#954;B signaling pathway components and proinflammatory cytokines and attracted fewer immune cells. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cytokines was strongly up-regulated in &lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to their WT counterparts. Like M cells, taste cells from WT but not &lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice readily took up fluorescently labeled microbeads, a proxy for microbial transcytosis. The proportion of taste cell subtypes are unaltered in &lt;i&gt;Spib&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; mice; however, they displayed increased attraction to sweet and umami taste stimuli. We propose that taste cells are involved in immune surveillance and may tune their taste responses to microbial signaling and infection.</description>

            <title>Sexual selection in females and the evolution of polyandry</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001916</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by Salom&#233; Fromonteil, Lucas Marie-Orleach, Lennart Winkler, Tim Janicke&lt;/p&gt;

Over the last decades, the field of sexual selection underwent a paradigm shift from sexual-stereotype thinking of &#8220;eager&#8221; males and &#8220;coy&#8221; females towards a more nuanced perspective acknowledging that not only males but also females can benefit from multiple mating and compete for mating partners. Yet, sexual selection in females is still considered a peculiarity, and the evolution of polyandry is often viewed to result from a higher mating interest of males. Here, we present meta-analytic evidence from 77 species across a broad range of animal taxa to demonstrate that female reproductive success is overall positively correlated with mating success, suggesting that females typically benefit from multiple mating. Importantly, we found that these fitness gains likely promote the evolution of polyandry. Our findings offer support for the idea that sexual selection is widespread in females and to play a key role for the evolution of animal mating systems. Thereby, our results extend our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of sexual reproduction and contribute to a more balanced view of how sexual selection operates in males and females.</description>

            <title>Nutritional compensation of the circadian clock is a conserved process influenced by gene expression regulation and mRNA stability</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001961</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina M. Kelliher, Elizabeth-Lauren Stevenson, Jennifer J. Loros, Jay C. Dunlap&lt;/p&gt;

Compensation is a defining principle of a true circadian clock, where its approximately 24-hour period length is relatively unchanged across environmental conditions. Known compensation effectors directly regulate core clock factors to buffer the oscillator&#8217;s period length from variables in the environment. Temperature Compensation mechanisms have been experimentally addressed across circadian model systems, but much less is known about the related process of Nutritional Compensation, where circadian period length is maintained across physiologically relevant nutrient levels. Using the filamentous fungus &lt;i&gt;Neurospora crassa&lt;/i&gt;, we performed a genetic screen under glucose and amino acid starvation conditions to identify new regulators of Nutritional Compensation. Our screen uncovered 16 novel mutants, and together with 4 mutants characterized in prior work, a model emerges where Nutritional Compensation of the fungal clock is achieved at the levels of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA stability. However, eukaryotic circadian Nutritional Compensation is completely unstudied outside of &lt;i&gt;Neurospora&lt;/i&gt;. To test for conservation in cultured human cells, we selected top hits from our fungal genetic screen, performed siRNA knockdown experiments of the mammalian orthologs, and characterized the cell lines with respect to compensation. We find that the wild-type mammalian clock is also compensated across a large range of external glucose concentrations, as observed in &lt;i&gt;Neurospora&lt;/i&gt;, and that knocking down the mammalian orthologs of the &lt;i&gt;Neurospora&lt;/i&gt; compensation-associated genes &lt;i&gt;CPSF6&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;SETD2&lt;/i&gt; in human cells also results in nutrient-dependent period length changes. We conclude that, like Temperature Compensation, Nutritional Compensation is a conserved circadian process in fungal and mammalian clocks and that it may share common molecular determinants.</description>

Accumulating observations suggest that peripheral somatosensory ganglia may regulate nociceptive transmission, yet direct evidence is sparse. Here, in experiments on rats and mice, we show that the peripheral afferent nociceptive information in mice undergoes dynamic filtering within the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and suggest that this filtering occurs at the axonal bifurcations (t-junctions). Using synchronous in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the peripheral and central processes of sensory neurons (in the spinal nerve and dorsal root), ganglionic transplantation of GABAergic progenitor cells, and optogenetics, we demonstrate existence of tonic and dynamic filtering of action potentials traveling through the DRG. Filtering induced by focal application of GABA or optogenetic GABA release from the DRG-transplanted GABAergic progenitor cells was specific to nociceptive fibers. Light-sheet imaging and computer modeling demonstrated that, compared to other somatosensory fiber types, nociceptors have shorter stem axons, making somatic control over t-junctional filtering more efficient. Optogenetically induced GABA release within DRG from the transplanted GABAergic cells enhanced filtering and alleviated hypersensitivity to noxious stimulation produced by chronic inflammation and neuropathic injury in vivo. These findings support &#8220;gating&#8221; of pain information by DRGs and suggest new therapeutic approaches for pain relief.</description>

            <title>Attachment of the RNA degradosome to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane prevents wasteful degradation of rRNA in ribosome assembly intermediates</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001942</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by Lydia Hadjeras, Marie Bouvier, Isabelle Canal, Leonora Poljak, Quentin Morin-Ogier, Carine Froment, Odile Burlet-Schlitz, Lina Hamouche, Laurence Girbal, Muriel Cocaign-Bousquet, Agamemnon J. Carpousis&lt;/p&gt;

RNA processing and degradation shape the transcriptome by generating stable molecules that are necessary for translation (rRNA and tRNA) and by facilitating the turnover of mRNA, which is necessary for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. In bacteria and the plant chloroplast, RNA degradosomes are multienzyme complexes that process and degrade RNA. In many bacterial species, the endoribonuclease RNase E is the central component of the RNA degradosome. RNase E-based RNA degradosomes are inner membrane proteins in a large family of gram-negative bacteria (&#946;- and &#947;-Proteobacteria). Until now, the reason for membrane localization was not understood. Here, we show that a mutant strain of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, in which the RNA degradosome is localized to the interior of the cell, has high levels of 20S and 40S particles that are defective intermediates in ribosome assembly. These particles have aberrant protein composition and contain rRNA precursors that have been cleaved by RNase E. After RNase E cleavage, rRNA fragments are degraded to nucleotides by exoribonucleases. In vitro, rRNA in intact ribosomes is resistant to RNase E cleavage, whereas protein-free rRNA is readily degraded. We conclude that RNA degradosomes in the nucleoid of the mutant strain interfere with cotranscriptional ribosome assembly. We propose that membrane-attached RNA degradosomes in wild-type cells control the quality of ribosome assembly after intermediates are released from the nucleoid. That is, the compact structure of mature ribosomes protects rRNA against cleavage by RNase E. Turnover of a proportion of intermediates in ribosome assembly explains slow growth of the mutant strain. Competition between mRNA and rRNA degradation could be the cause of slower mRNA degradation in the mutant strain. We conclude that attachment of the RNA degradosome to the bacterial inner cytoplasmic membrane prevents wasteful degradation of rRNA precursors, thus explaining the reason for conservation of membrane-attached RNA degradosomes throughout the &#946;- and &#947;-Proteobacteria.</description>

            <title>A central CRMP complex essential for invasion in &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;</title>

Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites. While most species are restricted to specific hosts and cell types, &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; can invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion. However, to date, only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for invasion, suggesting functional redundancy that might allow such a broad host range. Cysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs) are a family of apicomplexan-specific proteins. In &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gondii&lt;/i&gt;, two CRMPs are present in the genome, CRMPA (TGGT1_261080) and CRMPB (TGGT1_292020). Here, we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex that contains the additional proteins MIC15 and the thrombospondin type 1 domain-containing protein (TSP1). Disruption of this complex results in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex conserved in all apicomplexans.</description>

            <title>Cortical representations of numbers and nonsymbolic quantities expand and segregate in children from 5 to 8 years of age</title>

Number symbols, such as Arabic numerals, are cultural inventions that have transformed human mathematical skills. Although their acquisition is at the core of early elementary education in children, it remains unknown how the neural representations of numerals emerge during that period. It is also unclear whether these relate to an ontogenetically earlier sense of approximate quantity. Here, we used multivariate fMRI adaptation coupled with within- and between-format machine learning to probe the cortical representations of Arabic numerals and approximate nonsymbolic quantity in 89 children either at the beginning (age 5) or four years into formal education (age 8). Although the cortical representations of both numerals and nonsymbolic quantities expanded from age 5 to age 8, these representations also segregated with learning and development. Specifically, a format-independent neural representation of quantity was found in the right parietal cortex, but only for 5-year-olds. These results are consistent with the so-called symbolic estrangement hypothesis, which argues that the relation between symbolic and nonsymbolic quantity weakens with exposure to formal mathematics in children.</description>

            <title>Identifying barriers and enablers to rigorous conduct and reporting of preclinical laboratory studies</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001932</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by Manoj M. Lalu, Justin Presseau, Madison K. Foster, Victoria T. Hunniford, Kelly D. Cobey, Jamie C. Brehaut, Carolina Ilkow, Joshua Montroy, Analyssa Cardenas, Ayni Sharif, Matthew S. Jeffers, Dean A. Fergusson&lt;/p&gt;

Use of rigorous study design methods and transparent reporting in publications are 2 key strategies proposed to improve the reproducibility of preclinical research. Despite promotion of these practices by funders and journals, assessments suggest uptake is low in preclinical research. Thirty preclinical scientists were interviewed to better understand barriers and enablers to rigorous design and reporting. The interview guide was informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, which is a framework used to understand determinants of current and desired behavior. Four global themes were identified; 2 reflecting enablers and 2 reflecting barriers. We found that basic scientists are highly motivated to apply the methods of rigorous design and reporting and perceive a number of benefits to their adoption (e.g., improved quality and reliability). However, there was varied awareness of the guidelines and in implementation of these practices. Researchers also noted that these guidelines can result in disadvantages, such as increased sample sizes, expenses, time, and can require several personnel to operationalize. Most researchers expressed additional resources such as personnel and education/training would better enable the application of some methods. Using existing guidance (Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW); Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) project implementation strategies), we mapped and coded our interview findings to identify potential interventions, policies, and implementation strategies to improve routine use of the guidelines by preclinical scientists. These findings will help inform specific strategies that may guide the development of programs and resources to improve experimental design and transparent reporting in preclinical research.</description>

            <title>Seasonal timing on a cyclical Earth: Towards a theoretical framework for the evolution of phenology</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001952</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by John S. Park, Eric Post&lt;/p&gt;

Phenology refers to the seasonal timing patterns commonly exhibited by life on Earth, from blooming flowers to breeding birds to human agriculture. Climate change is altering abiotic seasonality (e.g., longer summers) and in turn, phenological patterns contained within. However, how phenology should evolve is still an unsolved problem. This problem lies at the crux of predicting future phenological changes that will likely have substantial ecosystem consequences, and more fundamentally, of understanding an undeniably global phenomenon. Most studies have associated proximate environmental variables with phenological responses in case-specific ways, making it difficult to contextualize observations within a general evolutionary framework. We outline the complex but universal ways in which seasonal timing maps onto evolutionary fitness. We borrow lessons from life history theory and evolutionary demography that have benefited from a first principles-based theoretical scaffold. Lastly, we identify key questions for theorists and empiricists to help advance our general understanding of phenology.</description>

The notion of epigenetic &#8220;marks&#8221; used by molecular biologists is conceptually disconnected from the idea of Waddington&#8217;s epigenetic &#8220;landscape&#8221; that is used by systems biologists and biophysicists.

            <title>The RNA export and RNA decay complexes THO and TRAMP prevent transcription-replication conflicts, DNA breaks, and CAG repeat contractions</title>

Expansion of structure-forming CAG/CTG repetitive sequences is the cause of several neurodegenerative disorders and deletion of repeats is a potential therapeutic strategy. Transcription-associated mechanisms are known to cause CAG repeat instability. In this study, we discovered that Thp2, an RNA export factor and member of the THO (suppressors of transcriptional defects of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;pr1&#916;&lt;/i&gt; by overexpression) complex, and Trf4, a key component of the TRAMP (Trf4/5-Air1/2-Mtr4 polyadenylation) complex involved in nuclear RNA polyadenylation and degradation, are necessary to prevent CAG fragility and repeat contractions in a &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; model system. Depletion of both Thp2 and Trf4 proteins causes a highly synergistic increase in CAG repeat fragility, indicating a complementary role of the THO and TRAMP complexes in preventing genome instability. Loss of either Thp2 or Trf4 causes an increase in RNA polymerase stalling at the CAG repeats and other genomic loci, as well as genome-wide transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), implicating TRCs as a cause of CAG fragility and instability in their absence. Analysis of the effect of RNase H1 overexpression on CAG fragility, RNAPII stalling, and TRCs suggests that RNAPII stalling with associated R-loops are the main cause of CAG fragility in the &lt;i&gt;thp2&#916;&lt;/i&gt; mutants. In contrast, CAG fragility and TRCs in the &lt;i&gt;trf4&#916;&lt;/i&gt; mutant can be compensated for by RPA overexpression, suggesting that excess unprocessed RNA in TRAMP4 mutants leads to reduced RPA availability and high levels of TRCs. Our results show the importance of RNA surveillance pathways in preventing RNAPII stalling, TRCs, and DNA breaks, and show that RNA export and RNA decay factors work collaboratively to maintain genome stability.</description>

Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity faces multiple threats, from invasive species to climate change. Yet no large-scale assessments of threat management strategies exist. Applying a structured participatory approach, we demonstrate that existing conservation efforts are insufficient in a changing world, estimating that 65% (at best 37%, at worst 97%) of native terrestrial taxa and land-associated seabirds are likely to decline by 2100 under current trajectories. Emperor penguins are identified as the most vulnerable taxon, followed by other seabirds and dry soil nematodes. We find that implementing 10 key threat management strategies in parallel, at an estimated present-day equivalent annual cost of US$23 million, could benefit up to 84% of Antarctic taxa. Climate change is identified as the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity and influencing global policy to effectively limit climate change is the most beneficial conservation strategy. However, minimising impacts of human activities and improved planning and management of new infrastructure projects are cost-effective and will help to minimise regional threats. Simultaneous global and regional efforts are critical to secure Antarctic biodiversity for future generations.</description>

            <title>Multispecies biofilm architecture determines bacterial exposure to phages</title>
            <link>https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001913</link>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;by James B. Winans, Benjamin R. Wucher, Carey D. Nadell&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous ecological interactions among microbes&#8212;for example, competition for space and resources, or interaction among phages and their bacterial hosts&#8212;are likely to occur simultaneously in multispecies biofilm communities. While biofilms formed by just a single species occur, multispecies biofilms are thought to be more typical of microbial communities in the natural environment. Previous work has shown that multispecies biofilms can increase, decrease, or have no measurable impact on phage exposure of a host bacterium living alongside another species that the phages cannot target. The reasons underlying this variability are not well understood, and how phage&#8211;host encounters change within multispecies biofilms remains mostly unexplored at the cellular spatial scale. Here, we study how the cellular scale architecture of model 2-species biofilms impacts cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;phage interactions controlling larger scale population and community dynamics. Our system consists of dual culture biofilms of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; under exposure to T7 phages, which we study using microfluidic culture, high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging, and detailed image analysis. As shown previously, sufficiently mature biofilms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; can protect themselves from phage exposure via their curli matrix. Before this stage of biofilm structural maturity, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is highly susceptible to phages; however, we show that these bacteria can gain lasting protection against phage exposure if they have become embedded in the bottom layers of highly packed groups of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cholerae&lt;/i&gt; in co-culture. This protection, in turn, is dependent on the cell packing architecture controlled by &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cholerae&lt;/i&gt; biofilm matrix secretion. In this manner, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; cells that are otherwise susceptible to phage-mediated killing can survive phage exposure in the absence of de novo resistance evolution. While co-culture biofilm formation with &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cholerae&lt;/i&gt; can confer phage protection to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, it comes at the cost of competing with &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cholerae&lt;/i&gt; and a disruption of normal curli-mediated protection for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; even in dual species biofilms grown over long time scales. This work highlights the critical importance of studying multispecies biofilm architecture and its influence on the community dynamics of bacteria and phages.</description>

Sustained attention (SA) and working memory (WM) are critical processes, but the brain networks supporting these abilities in development are unknown. We characterized the functional brain architecture of SA and WM in 9- to 11-year-old children and adults. First, we found that adult network predictors of SA generalized to predict individual differences and fluctuations in SA in youth. A WM model predicted WM performance both across and within children&#8212;and captured individual differences in later recognition memory&#8212;but underperformed in youth relative to adults. We next characterized functional connections differentially related to SA and WM in youth compared to adults. Results revealed 2 network configurations: a dominant architecture predicting performance in both age groups and a secondary architecture, more prominent for WM than SA, predicting performance in each age group differently. Thus, functional connectivity (FC) predicts SA and WM in youth, with networks predicting WM performance differing more between youths and adults than those predicting SA.</description>

Viruses must balance their reliance on host cell machinery for replication while avoiding host defense. Influenza A viruses are zoonotic agents that frequently switch hosts, causing localized outbreaks with the potential for larger pandemics. The host range of influenza virus is limited by the need for successful interactions between the virus and cellular partners. Here we used immunocompetitive capture-mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with human- and avian-style viral polymerases. We focused on the proviral activity of heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein U-like 1 (hnRNP UL1) and the antiviral activity of mitochondrial enoyl CoA-reductase (MECR). MECR is localized to mitochondria where it functions in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). While a small fraction of the polymerase subunit PB2 localizes to the mitochondria, PB2 did not interact with full-length MECR. By contrast, a minor splice variant produces cytoplasmic MECR (cMECR). Ectopic expression of cMECR shows that it binds the viral polymerase and suppresses viral replication by blocking assembly of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). MECR ablation through genome editing or drug treatment is detrimental for cell health, creating a generic block to virus replication. Using the yeast homolog Etr1 to supply the metabolic functions of MECR in MECR-null cells, we showed that specific antiviral activity is independent of mtFAS and is reconstituted by expressing cMECR. Thus, we propose a strategy where alternative splicing produces a cryptic antiviral protein that is embedded within a key metabolic enzyme.</description>

            <title>ERR2 and ERR3 promote the development of gamma motor neuron functional properties required for proprioceptive movement control</title>

The ability of terrestrial vertebrates to effectively move on land is integrally linked to the diversification of motor neurons into types that generate muscle force (alpha motor neurons) and types that modulate muscle proprioception, a task that in mammals is chiefly mediated by gamma motor neurons. The diversification of motor neurons into alpha and gamma types and their respective contributions to movement control have been firmly established in the past 7 decades, while recent studies identified gene expression signatures linked to both motor neuron types. However, the mechanisms that promote the specification of gamma motor neurons and/or their unique properties remained unaddressed. Here, we found that upon selective loss of the orphan nuclear receptors ERR2 and ERR3 (also known as ERR&#946;, ERR&#947; or NR3B2, NR3B3, respectively) in motor neurons in mice, morphologically distinguishable gamma motor neurons are generated but do not acquire characteristic functional properties necessary for regulating muscle proprioception, thus disrupting gait and precision movements. Complementary gain-of-function experiments in chick suggest that ERR2 and ERR3 could operate via transcriptional activation of neural activity modulators to promote a gamma motor neuron biophysical signature of low firing thresholds and high firing rates. Our work identifies a mechanism specifying gamma motor neuron functional properties essential for the regulation of proprioceptive movement control.</description>

Activity of sensory neurons is driven not only by external stimuli but also by feedback signals from higher brain areas. Attention is one particularly important internal signal whose presumed role is to modulate sensory representations such that they only encode information currently relevant to the organism at minimal cost. This hypothesis has, however, not yet been expressed in a normative computational framework. Here, by building on normative principles of probabilistic inference and efficient coding, we developed a model of dynamic population coding in the visual cortex. By continuously adapting the sensory code to changing demands of the perceptual observer, an attention-like modulation emerges. This modulation can dramatically reduce the amount of neural activity without deteriorating the accuracy of task-specific inferences. Our results suggest that a range of seemingly disparate cortical phenomena such as intrinsic gain modulation, attention-related tuning modulation, and response variability could be manifestations of the same underlying principles, which combine efficient sensory coding with optimal probabilistic inference in dynamic environments.</description>

Hybridization is frequent in the wild but it is unclear when admixture events lead to predictable outcomes and if so, at what timescale. We show that selection led to correlated sorting of genetic variation rapidly after admixture in 3 hybrid &lt;i&gt;Formica aquilonia&lt;/i&gt; &#215; &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;polyctena&lt;/i&gt; ant populations. Removal of ancestry from the species with the lowest effective population size happened in all populations, consistent with purging of deleterious load. This process was modulated by recombination rate variation and the density of functional sites. Moreover, haplotypes with signatures of positive selection in either species were more likely to fix in hybrids. These mechanisms led to mosaic genomes with comparable ancestry proportions. Our work demonstrates predictable evolution over short timescales after admixture in nature.</description>

You can view a simpler version of this photosynthesis activity here. This worksheet helps to reinforce concepts presented in the class lecture. The graphic is also embedded within the slides so that you can pause and have students practice labeling before continuing to the Calvin Cycle. The first graphic on this worksheet is the basic overview of the light dependent reaction and the Calvin cycle.. It focuses on the general reactants and products of each reaction. In the second graphic, students take a closer look at the light&lt;/p&gt;

This bird is so striking that seven states list it as their state bird. Red coloration is not that common in nature, seen mainly in flowers and birds and some fur colors. The red coloration is the result of carotenoids that have been converted to ketocarotenoids by enzymes. The mechanism is complex and involves several intermediaries. This short explanation is based on a study from Nature with a simplified graphic to illustrate how enzymes are involved. There are several genes that work together to express red coloration. These genes&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>Who determines the value of a life in a desperate situation? When it comes to cats and dogs, sadly, so many find themselves at the mercy of the over-crowded, under-funded, exhausted shelter system. Shelters do their very best; I believe this to be absolutely true. Unfortunately, for high-need animals&amp;#8211;those with severe injuries or illness&amp;#8211;there aren&amp;#8217;t [&amp;#8230;]</description>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;#8217;t think to have an Elephant as a pet, Elephants are smart enough to be trained like dogs, and can be house trained, walked on a lead and even taught basic tricks. The trend of keeping Elephants as pets, however, has led to an influx of pet Elephants to rescue, as their well-meaning owners &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Having a Pet Bear is like having any other Wild Animal Pet, though some feel they are wonderful pets, many opponents argue that they are unpredictable, impossible to train, and inherently dangerous. Because of this, having a bear as a pet is illegal in many places and is often associated with many rules in others &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&amp;#160; In 1977, a man named John Huffer took several photos of two large birds taking flight from a tree. Although the sighting was mentioned by the Discovery Channel on their show,&#160;Into the Unknown, the birds pictured in the photos were dismissed as turkey vultures rather than Thunderbirds. &#160;This reality television appearance was linked to the sightings in Lawndale, Illinois. John Huffer, known later as Chief A. J. Huffer became a well-known advocate of giant cryptid birds. Thunderbird sightings have continued into the new millennium. &amp;#160; On March 29, 2022,&#160;&#8221;Chief AJ&#8221; Huffer suffered a fall. The doctors discovered a serious [...]</description>

            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/streeters-jetty-broome.htm</link>
            <description>After all of the recent flooding we don&amp;#8217;t anticipate being able to travel very far in coming months by vehicle. Main Roads are updating the website several times a day as the situation changes, but with bridges completely destroyed to the north it will be a very long time before we can head that way. Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty in Broome is heritage listed and is known to have existed since 1897 and is an excellent place to go birding. Until last year you had to be very careful of your footing due to it being in quite a bad state of repair. The jetty has now been repaired and offers a hand rail on one side as well. It is handy to check the tide chart before you venture out onto the jetty, because the tides are very big in Broome and there may be a lot of mud exposed or there may even be water on the jetty itself during our biggest tides. When the tide drops there are hundreds of crabs on the mud. The majority of the crabs do appear to be left-handed, but you do see some right-handed ones too! Crabs on the mud at Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty At this time of year there are often flocks of Oriental Pratincoles soaring across the sky in search of grasshoppers. Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty is also under the flight path for the airport and standing on the jetty you can expect to see planes fly straight over you. There are some Oriental Pratincoles in the photos below, which appear as specks! Plane flying over Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty If you do happen to be on the jetty when the planes come in then you may not initially hear the bird-life. There are so few planes coming into Broome airport each day that you won&amp;#8217;t be waiting long and then you will soon hear the birds. Often the first bird you will hear calling is the Mangrove Golden Whistler. They don&amp;#8217;t always show themselves and if they do you might only get a brief chance to photograph them. Mangrove Golden Whistler One of the other birds that you often hear, but don&amp;#8217;t always see well enough to photograph is the Dusky Gerygone. Yellow White-eyes are very good at flitting back and forth across the channel and blending well in the mangrove trees. Yellow White-eyes One of the highlights of any visit to Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty is the Red-headed Honeyeaters that flit amongst the trees. They have also worked out that the air-conditioning from the building closest to the jetty drips fresh water through a big pipe. They can often be observed at the pipe bathing and drinking and many other bird species join them. Standing on the jetty you can easily observe the birds visiting the overflow pipe. Red-headed Honeyeaters You may not be at the Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty very long at all to observe the bird-life, but one thing that will be very apparent is that the tide drops back very fast and before you know it it will be surrounded by mud rather than water. Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty If you happen to fly into Broome in coming months you may not be able to travel far by road, but you can easily wander down to Streeter&amp;#8217;s Jetty and enjoy our local bird-life.</description>

            <title>The Biggest Urban Pygmy Cormorant Roost is Finally Protected!!</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/the-biggest-urban-pygmy-cormorant-roost-is-finally-protected.htm</link>
            <description>It all started during the icy February of 1996. The night temperatures in Belgrade, Serbia, were already below minus 10 Celsius / 14 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks. Everything was frozen solid and pack ice was floating down the Danube. Hiding from the elements at the riverbank, I was sitting in a Yugo and staring at the murky sky. Whenever the windscreen got frozen, I could not afford to turn the engine on due to petrol shortages (during the UN embargo on the import of fuel to the former Yugoslavia), so I would turn on a mini camping gas stove to defrost the windows and warm up my cocoon, keeping one eye at the sky and the other at the flames, to make sure they do not catch the seat. What was I doing there? Back in those days, Pygmy Cormorants Microcarbo pygmeus were considered Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List and were quite uncommon, having just returned to the city after half a century of absence. Up to the mid-20th century, Pygmy Cormorant was a common breeding species of wetlands around Belgrade until most wetlands were drained and the birds were lost, at one moment &#8211; from the entire territory of Serbia. With the construction of the huge Iron Gates dam on the Danube, the birds returned to breed in newly flooded river islands. And in the late 1980s they returned to Belgrade, too, but only to overwinter within the city. In recent years, the overwintering population in Belgrade is around 4,000 Pygmy Cormorants, representing 2 percent of the global population and over 5 percent of the European population. One of the very first Pygmy Cormorant promotions: League for Ornithological Action organised this roost watch in December 2004. Photo Milan Obradovic.&#160;In the last few hours of daylight, Pygmy Cormorants commute from the river Danube back to their roost on the Sava River, to several willow groves by the Ada Ciganlija Island, using the rivers as the flight corridors. Therefore, you can observe them in their hundreds and thousands if you spend the last hour of the day observing the flight corridor and distinguishing distant black Pygmy Cormorant dots from other equally distant and black Rook and Jackdaw dots, all of them melting into tree crowns as the sunset thickens.The biggest threat to Pygmy Cormorants overwintering in Belgrade is urbanization of its riverbanks and destruction of remaining willow groves, which sparked the 2009 initiative by the Belgrade Land Development Public Agency, League for Ornithological Action (a local NGO) and the Institute for Nature Conservation of Serbia to protect the remaining roosting sites of this species.By both Serbian legislation and the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, Pygmy Cormorant is a strictly protected species. In the European Union, they are included on the Annex I of the Birds Directive and their habitats are therefore potential Natura2000 ecological network sites.For almost 20 years during which the League for Ornithological Action had been following the Pygmy Cormorant in Belgrade, the maximum number was recorded in the winter of 2007/2008, when the population counted 6,728 individuals. This shows the great importance of the Sava riverbanks, in the heart of a capital, for the conservation of biological diversity, which has an importance that transcends national borders.And after 13 years of campaigning by the League for Ornithological Action, in March 2022 the Ministry of Environmental Protection informed the public about the procedure for initiating the protection of a natural area of the third category, as the Protected Habitat &amp;#8220;Winter Roosts of Pygmy Cormorants&amp;#8221;. The decision to declare the &amp;#8220;Winter Roosts of Pygmy Cormorants&amp;#8221; as a protected area was adopted at the last session of the Belgrade City Assembly.I waited for a long time, at one stage losing all hope, but finally, 23 ha / 57 ac of this tiny reserve are off the hook for the future development plans.In the same 2022, Beljarica and the wider Danube Backwaters &#8211; another reserve that I initiated and proposed, also became protected, bringing my personal total to 1881 ha / 4648 acres of newly protected areas (mostly forests) in my city. I hope that covers my carbon footprint. Cover photo (c) Maciej Szymanski</description>

            <title>Bird of the Year?</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/bird-of-the-year.htm</link>
            <description>Yes, I understand what you are thinking. How can one, in what is barely the second week of the first month of the year &amp;#8211; even think of suggesting a Bird of the Year? Well, let me explain. I began recording my bird sightings with photographs in late 2009, and since then I have seen (or at least heard) a fair proportion of species recorded within my home country of Trinidad &amp;#38; Tobago. The euphoria of chasing sightings lasted for only a few years, eventually giving way to my current ethos of simply putting myself in place and letting nature toss me whatever she feels I need. This enriching practice makes fortuitous sightings even more precious when they do occur. One of T&amp;#38;T&amp;#8217;s resident species has been taking me for a real run around since I began birding &amp;#8211; the delicately beautiful Mangrove Cuckoo. I first caught sight of one while birding a mangrove swamp in 2012. The view was of its rich buff underside and long, spotted tail as it flew from treetop to treetop &amp;#8211; if I say the view lasted a full second I&amp;#8217;m being generous. The second time I saw one was late in 2020 (could be 2021, the pandemic years are a blur), where a small group of photographers were enjoying (apparently) a bird in full view. It took me a while to find it and as soon as I laid eyes on the bird it flew off, never to be seen again. As I&amp;#8217;ve been on Tobago for the last year, many have expressed surprise that I had never photographed a Mangrove Cuckoo. After all, it was a straightforward procedure: drive to the mangrove swamps, play the call, photograph the bird, leave. I experienced this first hand while attending last year&amp;#8217;s CBC, but because I&amp;#8217;m motivated by feelings I didn&amp;#8217;t consider this a true experience. Nature is an infinitely unpredictable organism and I&amp;#8217;m happy to bird naturally. Which brings me to the happenings of yesterday morning. After an enjoyable sunrise session on the beach with several Whimbrels, Southern Lapwings (including a partially leucistic individual!), and Black-bellied Plovers, we were just packing up and finalizing arrangements for where to have breakfast. I had just switched my camera off and tossed the binoculars into the back seat when Joanne pointed out a bird that was perched almost directly overhead. Yeah, you guessed it &amp;#8211; a Mangrove Cuckoo! Whimbrel Black-bellied Plovers are always fun to spend time with! This partially leucistic Southern Lapwing didn&amp;#8217;t seem in the least bit ostracized by its peers. A lesson we are gradually learning. I forgot all about breakfast and tracked the bird for about twenty minutes as it foraged in the treetops, only occasionally sitting for longer than a few seconds. Most of those times it was obscured by branches, but I did manage some images I&amp;#8217;m happy with. My arms were already shaking by the time the Mangrove Cuckoo hopped on this open branch but fortunately advancements in software now mean that I can salvage images I would&amp;#8217;ve previously tossed. What a gorgeous bird! Given how many times I&amp;#8217;ve missed out seeing a Mangrove Cuckoo over the years and the close calls I&amp;#8217;ve had with the species, I&amp;#8217;m moved to consider this as a real contender for my BOTY. Of course, a major factor in this decision rests in its status as a resident species. Will it be upstaged by another? Who knows what this year will bring?! Perhaps finally an opportunity with a Pearl Kite (don&amp;#8217;t get me started on this), or the holy grail itself &amp;#8211; Scaled Antpitta. 2023, you have 50 weeks, let&amp;#8217;s see what happens!</description>

            <title>Puerto Rico&#8217;s Birds after Hurricane Maria (2023 Update)</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/puerto-ricos-birds-after-hurricane-maria.htm</link>
            <description>In September of 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by two powerful hurricanes: it was grazed by Irma and then clobbered by Maria, a Category 4 storm that cut a devastating swath across the island. The human and economic consequences were dramatic and persistent. These hurricanes prompted a personal interest in the impact of hurricanes on birds, so I did some research, which ultimately led to an article in the April 2018 issue of Birding magazine. Broadly speaking, most birds appear to survive the initial &#8220;direct&#8221; effects (e.g., high winds, rain, landslides, and flooding) of hurricanes, but are significantly impacted by the &#8220;indirect&#8221; effects (e.g., loss of food supplies and roosting sites). Immediately after hurricanes, surviving birds appear to wander in an effort to find any remaining food supplies and suitable habitat. Birds that rely on a closed canopy, mature trees, or nectar, fruits, or seeds may struggle to survive. For example, hummingbirds must find patches where there are still flowers. Species with small ranges (e.g., single island endemics) or tiny populations (e.g., endangered species) are especially vulnerable. But as the months pass, forests and other habitats regenerate and many birds return. Over the longer term, forests mature, closing hurricane-created gaps in the canopy, at least until the inevitable next hurricane. Studying the impact of hurricanes requires data from before and after the event. However, there are few long-term avian studies in the Caribbean. Much of what exists is from Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory where researchers have numerous ongoing investigations, including many studies in El Yunque National Forest. Christmas Bird Counts administered by the National Audubon Society are one source of data. CBCs have been conducted for years in several locations in Puerto Rico, utilizing consistent procedures that can provide comparable &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; data. The Fajardo CBC has been conducted since 1994. Fajardo is in the northeastern corner of Puerto Rico and the count area includes parts of El Yunque. There have been six counts since Maria: (1) December 17, 2017; (2) December 16, 2018; (3) December 15, 2019; (4) December 21, 2020; (5) and December 19, 2021; and (6) December 18, 2022. The 2017 Count The 2017 CBC was conducted just a few months after Maria and forests were still extensively defoliated, with countless felled trees and snapped branches. Some plants had started to re-sprout, but recovery was in the very early stages. Nevertheless, the 2017 CBC tallied 1,934 birds of 82 species, both of which were low counts for past CBCs (e.g., the 2016 CBC had 2,579 birds, 97 species). When corrected for search effort in the field, participant groups found 1.8 species per party hour, a value not much lower than the mean for counts of the previous 10 years and within the range of earlier counts (1.8-2.2). However, they found only 43 individual birds per hour, well below the 10-year mean of 59.6, as well as below the 10-year range (47.7-68.2). Some species experienced dramatic declines. For example, nectarivores (e.g., hummingbirds and Bananaquits) showed a significant drop, which was not surprising given the loss of flowers to high winds. Most shorebird species fell too. Surprisingly, however, a few actually increased, including Scaly-naped Pigeon, Red-legged Thrush, Puerto Rican Oriole, and Puerto Rican Tody. Others were essentially unchanged. The causes of these inconsistent results are unclear. Some birds may have had to forage more actively, causing them to be observed more frequently, even if there were fewer of them. And post-hurricane habitats themselves may lead to increased detection, as there are no leaves to obscure the birds. Moreover, because many areas lacked a canopy altogether, birds that typically spend time high in trees are forced to ground level, where they are more likely to be observed. And numerous birds may cluster around remaining food sources (e.g., Royal Palms for frugivores), increasing the probability of detection. Overall, post-hurricane CBC observers saw species at a rate slightly lower than previous counts, but far fewer birds overall. The 2018 Count By the 2018 CBC, although there were still obvious signs of structural damage in the forests, most foliage had returned. But there were still large gaps in tree canopies that had been closed before the hurricanes. The 2018 CBC tallied 2,492 birds of 87 species. Both numbers were higher than 2017, but still relatively low compared to pre-hurricane counts. When corrected for search effort, participant groups found 2.0 species per party hour, within the range of earlier counts (1.8-2.2). They found 57 individual birds per hour, consistent with the 10-year mean (59.6) and within the 10-year range (47.7-68.2). There were some exceptions. For example, most nectivore numbers continued to be low. Thus, the 2018 CBC suggested that bird populations within the count area were gradually returning to pre-hurricane levels. Indeed, the 2018 count even added two new species: Black-throated Green Warbler and Greater Flamingo. The 2019 Count In 2019, there was still structural damage in the forests, but most foliage had returned. Many canopy gaps continued, and saplings, vines, and ferns flourished in those openings. The 2019 CBC tallied 2,308 birds of 90 species, similar to 2018. When corrected for search effort, 2.3 species per party hour were detected, which was at the high end of the 10-year range (1.8-2.3). Participants found 58 individual birds per hour, consistent with the historical mean (59.6) and within the historical range (47.7-68.2). Nectivores continued their slow recovery, except for the Bananaquit, which had now fully rebounded, likely due to its high reproductive rates. Hummingbird numbers were still low compared to historical numbers. Although there were variations among species, seed-eating finch counts were still low, but dove numbers were similar to baseline levels. Insectivores were on the low end of the historical ranges, omnivores were within the range, and raptors were below after returning the baseline in 2018. Waterbirds and shorebirds were generally within the historical range. Thus, overall the 2019 data showed continuing avian population recovery, with many species returning to pre-hurricane baseline levels, albeit with some exceptions (e.g., Antillean Crested Hummingbird,...</description>

            <title>Birding Napo, Guangxi, China &#8211; part 1</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/birding-napo-guangxi-china-part-1.htm</link>
            <description>Napo is a county in the West of Guangxi, bordering both Yunnan and Vietnam. It is about 3 hours by car from Nanning airport, which in turn can be reached from Shanghai in a 2.5-hour flight. While Napos relative remoteness made it seem less vulnerable to covid, on the second day of our hotel stay we were informed that they could no longer service the hotel rooms as all the hotel service staff had contracted the virus. Which made the rest of the trip a bit of a waiting period for contracting covid &amp;#8230; Apparently, the Large Niltava is Asia&#8217;s largest flycatcher. That comes at a price &#8211; the HBW describes the species as &#8220;stocky and fairly sluggish&#8221; and &#8211; with a critical undertone &#8211; continues to state that the species is &#8220;generally less agile in flight than are most flycatchers&#8221;. I would like to see the speed at which some of the HBW editors catch flies &amp;#8230; The male is quite &amp;#8220;in your face&amp;#8221; while the female is a bit more subdued. Quite elegant, in fact. If you aim to achieve some kind of immortality, you might do worse than follow the example of Oana Mirela Chachula, a biologist at the National Museum of Romanian History, Romania. Apparently, she supported the research of a Romanian team on ectoparasites of birds from Meghalaya (India) &#8211; and for her troubles, the team thanked her by naming a species of feather mite newly discovered on Large Niltava after her. &amp;#160; (Side note: Should anyone involved in discovering new species enjoy reading this blog, please refrain from naming any newly discovered species after me &#8211; particularly if these species are of the itchy or vaguely disgusting kind. End of side note). I only saw the female taking a bath &amp;#8211; coincidence? &amp;#160; Even in China&#8217;s slightly more remote provinces, one is never far away from species with treacherously pornographic names such as Japanese Tit. Why are people always thinking about sex? &amp;#160; The Grey-bellied Tesia is described by eBird by the seemingly Tolkien-inspired description &#8220;Long-legged and short-tailed, this tiny bird moves rapidly and unseen through dark, dense undergrowth like a pint-sized shadow&#8221;. The text just about manages not to use the word &#8220;elf&#8221;. Fortunately, it is actually not quite as difficult to photograph as the appallingly bad photo of the eBird report suggests, though it indeed moves quickly. Why the Latin species name is cyaniventer (meaning having a dark blue belly) remains a mystery to me though. The Bar-backed Partridge is a species of partridge found in southwestern China and Southeast Asia. It should not be confused with &amp;#8220;Bareback Partridge&amp;#8221;, a desultory term used to describe certain sexual practices among pheasants in general. &amp;#160; The Bar-backed Partridge was also one of four focal species in an investigation into illegal bird hunting in Southwestern China. Sadly, that study found that perceived entertainment and recreational value are main motivators for illegal hunting rather than economic considerations: &amp;#8220;Contrary to previous findings highlighting subsistence and finance as major factors driving hunting, the most important predictors of hunting activity in this landscape were related to attitudes regarding the enjoyment of hunting&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Shoot us, it is fun!&amp;#8221; Unfortunately, this makes it much less likely this hunting will stop once people get richer. Then again, I guess this conclusion could easily have been drawn from the popularity of hunting in the US &amp;#8230; Hopefully, in a few hundred years, the sculptures of famous people who in their lives enjoyed hunting will be destroyed like the sculptures of slave traders today. The Sooty-headed Bulbul was the subject of a similar study &amp;#8211; the authors checked whether the flight initiation distance of the bird is related to hunting pressure in a given area. Unsurprisingly, it is. If I can give you some advice: Better not be a bird in China. The usually fairly friendly eBird reviewers give a rather harsh assessment of the Scarlet-faced Liocichla as a &amp;#8220;Garish medium-sized laughingthrush-like bird&amp;#8221;. It is hard to blame them given the color combination sported by the species, though it makes me wonder why the Silver-eared Mesia with a similarly broad array of colors is described as a &amp;#8220;beautiful small babbler&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Me, garish?&amp;#8221; The mystery deepens when reading the species description in the HBW: &amp;#8220;Fairly small babbler, mostly plain brown but with &#173;scarlet face and scarlet in wings and tail&amp;#8221;. That does not really sound garish, right? On the other hand, to me, a length of 21-23 cm does not sound like a &amp;#8220;fairly small babbler&amp;#8221; given that babblers are &amp;#8220;small to medium birds&amp;#8221; (Wikipedia). Confusing. Strangely, eBird gives the Red-tailed Laughingthrush a much better review as an &amp;#8220;exquisitely- and distinctively-colored laughingthrush&amp;#8221;. The species gets its Latin name milnei from Alphonse Milne-Edwards (1835-1900), a French mammalogist,&#160;ornithologist, and&#160;carcinologist (it seems multitasking was easier then).&#160;From the fact that I do not have anything exciting to write about him, you can deduce that I did not make him up (my imaginary ornithologists tend to be a bit more interesting, having at least committed some atrocities or fathered a number of illegitimate children). The only vaguely specific thing I can say about him from his photo in his Wikipedia entry is that he had already lost a substantial part of his hair at age 48. Maybe doing ornithological research was just his way of compensation. If you ever consider opening a haunted house, you might want to get some of these birds &amp;#8211; according to the HBW, their sound includes&#160;phrases such as &#8220;uuu-weeoo&#8221;, &#8220;eeoo-wee&#8221; or shorter &#8220;uuuwi&#8221; or &#8220;uuuu-hiu-hiu&#8221; and &#8220;uuuu-hiu-hiu-hiu&#8221;. eBird is also back to its usual positive self in describing the Black-headed Greenfinch as a &amp;#8220;handsome yellowish finch&amp;#8221;. The poor Common Tailorbird is a host to the Plaintive Cuckoo. Researchers examined the interaction between the host and the cuckoo chicks and found that it is more or less the same as the one known from Common Cuckoos. That does not keep them from making the rather pompous claim that the &amp;#8220;developmental data on Plaintive Cuckoo nestlings...</description>

            <title>Broome&#8217;s birds get a battering</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/broomes-birds-get-a-battering.htm</link>
            <description>One of the best indications that we are going to get rain is that our pink Storm Lilies start to flower. The flowers above are Zephyranthes grandiflora and they are a small bulb that flowers when the air pressure drops. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter how much water you give them to encourage flowers, because a storm is required before they flower. We also have white Rain Lilies Pancratium zeylanicum that also depend on the air pressure changing to flower. White Rain Lily As you can see, both species of bulbs are flowering and there is a good reason for that. The first few days of 2023 have been extremely wet in Broome and surrounding areas and we have come off it lightly in town really. I know I suggested you could come and explore Australia, but it really does depend on where you want to go and when. A very reliable source of information for the highways in Western Australia is the Main Roads Travel Map. The north of Western Australia is no longer accessible by road due to unprecedented flooding. Fitzroy Crossing in particular has suffered the most in the last few days with the town flooded and the bridge severely damaged. The river height reached 15.81m and the river height gauge then failed, but the water level is slowly dropping as it moves further downstream towards Langi Crossing and then the sea. If you can imagine the Low Level Crossing with an extra 15.81 metres of water height then you can understand it is a lot of extra water. The rain does not need to fall in a town that a river runs through for it to flood. The river catchment area is massive and it will continue to flow for many months now offering some serious challenges to the bridge structural engineers. Broome has received a lot of rain these last few days, but we are now starting to dry out. Broome weather statistics are a mean average rainfall of 194.1mm for the whole of January, which is our wettest month normally. Our mean average is 627.6mm for the whole year. These records are from 1939 until 2022, but they will be adjusted after what we have just received. We have just had 565.4mm of rain in the first 6 days of January. Broome rainfall Tropical Cyclone Ellie had dropped to be an ex-cyclone, but she sat over Broome for a few days showing us that Mother Nature is in charge. Although it is a bit miserable having to stay inside watching your grass grow underwater it is even more miserable for the birds. For two days we didn&amp;#8217;t see or hear birds other than Oriental Pratincoles that somehow managed to fight the wind and feed. On Friday, when the wind dropped, there were many of them just sat on the roads clearly exhausted. There are very good storm drains around Broome and all of the rainwater goes into massive ditches and then is controlled to go out into Roebuck Bay. However, it is a lot of water to clear and it is still slowly moving through the drainage systems. Our blue sea has become a muddy colour for obvious reasons. Storm water drains Australian White Ibis in a storm water drain The Plumed Whistling-Ducks have dispersed and we are hearing them overhead now and they have plenty of places to stand around in muddy water now. Plumed Whistling-Ducks The Masked Lapwings have been breeding and their young are having to deal with more puddles than they would normally have to. Masked Lapwing chick The Willie Wagtail is hardly standing still as it chases the flying ants and flits about constantly. Willie Wagtail As soon as we heard birds coming into our garden on Friday morning around 5.30am I went out to give them some food. They had really had a tough couple of days and anything we could do to help we would. There were soon a couple of dozen very hungry Double-barred Finch in the garden along with Bar-shouldered Doves. Double-barred Finch We have been looking for one of our Tawny Frogmouth families that still had young at Christmas and are yet to find them. No doubt they have been watching us and we hope to establish where they are now roosting. The Tawny Frogmouth that is blind in one eye remains in the middle of the dense tree in the middle of a roundabout and was clearly a bit tired after all of the rain. Tawny Frogmouth having a yawn! So, although we had a good day birding around Broome observing 113 bird species on January 1st we are now restricted on where we travel until the water level subsides. We can expect the highway south to offer excellent birding opportunities once we are allowed to travel on it again. We can expect more rain in the coming weeks and months, because this is our &amp;#8220;Wet Season&amp;#8221;, but nobody was really expecting quite this much rain!</description>

            <title>Afforestation 2022</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/afforestation-2022.htm</link>
            <description>Eighteen months ago, I wrote about a particular passion project of mine, which is to create a mini-forest on part of our church&amp;#8217;s one acre of land. This project qualifies as &amp;#8220;afforestation&amp;#8221;, which is the creation of a forest in a site that was not originally forested &amp;#8212; as opposed to reforestation, which creates a new forest on a site that was previously forested but has been logged. Creating a new forest is my way of turning intense frustration into positive action. Birding in the developing world means being a witness to constant habitat destruction. So I am attempting to respond, by creating new habitat. I try not to talk too much with my long-suffering congregation about birds. But I do have to mention &amp;#8220;mis arbolitos&amp;#8221; (my little trees), since they are growing on the church lot itself. So I am happy that this year many of mis arbolitos have finally reached a size where they can be noticed from a distance. Now they know I&amp;#8217;m not just making this all up. Look, real trees you can actually see! This is what was there before my &amp;#8220;forest&amp;#8221;. The classic highland forest in Michoac&#225;n is known as pine-oak forest, and many of my 22 pine trees are now at least knee high, while three are already chest high, and one (my only surviving pine purchased from a commercial nursery) is taller than I am. Most of these pine trees were bought from reforestation nurseries, for fifty U.S. cents each. (Because of their availability and low price, I have not learned to grow these from seed.) The same price also bought me five cedros blancos, which, in spite of their name of &amp;#8220;white cedars&amp;#8221;, are actually native cypresses. These are also chest high, after only one year in the ground. On the left is a Michoac&#225;n pine; on the right is an Ocote pine (named for a resinous pine wood used as fire starter kindling). This Ocote pine is almost my height, but took five summers to reach that height. The pine to its left (I&amp;#8217;m not sure which variety) has only been in the ground for 18 months. These Cedros may look skinny, but they have grown from a few inches to four feet in a year and a half. That&amp;#8217;s an adult Cedro on another property, in the background. The ahuehuete, or Mexican Bald Cypress, is a tree with a rich relationship to Mexican history. It is also beautiful, and is one of the few trees I have been willing to spend real money on (two-to-four dollars each). I now have three chest-high ahuehuetes growing on the lot, as they are well adapted to our wet/dry climate. Bald Cypresses have soft needles that can drop in the winter, and will grow happily in swamps. But the Mexican Bald Cypress can handle our dry winters as well. I plant them on the wettest parts (in summer) of the church property. Unfortunately, while conifers may be our easiest native trees to purchase, they do not offer all that much to birds in the way of food. In contrast, oak trees are our native avian supermarkets; but I have yet to find a reforestation or commercial nursery that offers them. So I have had to climb a steep learning curve to learn to grow them from seed, or rather, from acorn. Two oak seedlings I was given in 2018, by a botanical garden, are still growing today. Since then, I have managed to grow eight more from acorns. Half of these were started just last year, so I have real hope for the future. My goal is to someday achieve a typical Michoacan mix of 40% pines, 40% oaks, and 20% other tree species. (I picked up some 30 apparently viable acorns just this morning, for the next crop. Viable acorns don&amp;#8217;t float in water.) This is one of my two oldest oaks. It looks a bit shaggy now, during our dry winter. But It doubled in size last spring, so I would say we are off to the races. This lovely little oak was an acorn in June. As for the other species, they include two tejocotes (Mexican Hawthorn, a tree that produces crabapple-like fruits), four colorines, a native coral tree that produces tubular red flowers for the hummingbirds, an equal number of guam&#250;chiles, which produce seeds surrounded by an edible white pulp, one native chokecherry, one ash tree, a parotilla, and two ceibas (kapok tree). I have also planted many prickly pear seedlings and cuttings, as this cactus produces both flowers and fruit for birds. And I have protected and cared for other native plants that have turned up on their own, particularly granjenos, which have now begun to produce their first tasty red fruits. After acting like a bush for several years, this Tejocote suddenly decided to be a tree this fall, and sent out this one leading shoot. I think it&amp;#8217;s looking forward to a big 2023. This Guam&#250;chil seedling is only 7 months old. You can barely see the first Granjeno fruits in the middle of this photo. They will eventually turn a deep red. Birds love them, and so do I. Of course, a forest does not consist only of trees. I managed to successfully start some wild grape vines this summer. I also planted a purchased blackberry plant. And my botanist friend gifted me some cucamelon seeds; this wild cucumber (native to Mexico) looks exactly like a tiny watermelon. I hope to show a photo someday soon&amp;#8230; but they have to sprout first. I have also planted a good number of non-native ornamentals and fruit-producing trees in the more visible part of the property: citrus, jacarandas, mulberries, a peach and a guava, etc. This is a bit of a concession to what most people consider &amp;#8220;a garden&amp;#8221;. Pomegranate trees have also sprouted everywhere, because our home tree contributes excess fruit to my compost piles. One of my 2022 projects was this traditional, non-native bit of...</description>

            <title>A Year of Birding in Costa Rica- Highlights and a Few Birds Missed</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/a-year-of-birding-in-costa-rica-highlights-and-a-few-birds-missed.htm</link>
            <description>Another year of birding in Costa Rica has come to an end, another one begins. What will the new year bring? I bet some tanager flocks will be in the cards; birding in Costa Rica tends to deliver. There should be a good number of hummingbirds and quetzals are waiting in the mountains. It&amp;#8217;s 2023 already and I have already started this year of birding. No quetzal trips yet but a good start nonetheless. First birds came in the form of migrants and resident species that live in an oasis of precious green space near home. An Ovenbird chipping from coffee bushes, a Mourning Warbler in the dense grass. A male American Redstart flashed its Halloween finery and other birds flitted into view. A flash of blue and red, male Painted Bunting! Slow movement in the foliage of a lime tree, there&amp;#8217;s a Yellow-throated Vireo doing its deliberate thing. A squadron of Brown Jays flaps overhead and a White-tailed Kite hovers into view. I&amp;#8217;ll take those first birds of the year, I celebrate them and look forward to more. With those birds, I already have some highlights for 2023. 2022 gave me a fair share of wonderful birds and birding experiences. Despite a fair degree of effort, I also had some unexpected misses. Those kept me below the 700 species threshhold but I won&amp;#8217;t complain about 691 species. I talk about my &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; year birds at my blog. These were some of the other many highlights of this past birding year. 48 Hummingbird Species In Costa Rica, seeing 48 hummingbird species means seeing nearly all of the regular ones. The one resident I missed was the Garden Emerald. Based on unwritten, invisible birding laws, this means I&amp;#8217;ll probably run into one tomorrow. But seriously, my hummingbird total is a reminder that if you go birding enough in Costa Rica, you have a fair chance of seeing all expected hummingbirds. The White-bellied Mountain-Gem is one of my favorites. Most Raptors I also saw a high percentage of the raptor species possible in Costa Rica. No, there weren&amp;#8217;t any sightings of ultra mega Crested Eagle or missing Solitary Eagle, or king Harpy Eagle on my part but I did connect with most of the rest. Hawk-eagles flapping butterfly wings high above rainforest, a Tiny Hawk at a popular feeding spot, cool Crane Hawks and Bicolored Hawk, and Hook-billed Kites and more. Missing was Great Black-Hawk, missing on account of not spending enough time looking in the right places and the species having undergone serious decline in Costa Rica over the past 20 years. I also failed to see a Pearl Kite, maybe one of my biggest misses of the year. The small shrike-kestrel size and demeanor of this beautiful little raptor make it seriously unobtrusive. I looked in some of the right places but failed to connect. Which also means I&amp;#8217;ll see one soon. All Cotingas The cotingas are special, weird, and wonderful birds. In Costa Rica, some of them are also rare and hard to find. I don&amp;#8217;t usually see all of them in a year but in 2022, luck and being in the right places worked to give me the following cotinga sweep: Rufous Piha&amp;#8211; Go birding in the right lowland rainforest hotspots and you&amp;#8217;ll hear the loud wolf whistles of this bird, probably see it too. I usually hear and see it in Carara, I may have also heard it at another one or two spots. Three-wattled Bellbird&amp;#8211; Another vociferous bird much easier to hear than see. The challenge to seeing it in the high season before March is that most birds are not at Monteverde, most are in other, less accessible areas. Luckily, in one of the most unforgettable birding experiences of my life, at Curi-Cancha, I shared wonderful scoped looks of a male bellbird with old and new friends and birding mentors from Buffalo, NY. Turquoise Cotinga&amp;#8211; Males at a patch of rainforest in the city of Perez Zeledon also seen with folks from Buffalo were the only ones I saw in 2022. Lovely Cotinga&amp;#8211; Once again, the continuing male at Rancho Naturalista was shared with the same group from Buffalo. We had a number of excellent birds on that trip! Snowy Cotinga&amp;#8211; Not seen that often but go birding in the right places and you will probably connect. I saw this cool bird near Limon, Sarapiqui, and at Cano Negro. Yellow-billed Cotinga&amp;#8211; I had excellent looks of this surreal, endangered species at Cerro Lodge, and Rincon de Osa. Bare-necked Umbrellabird&amp;#8211; Any view of this endangered species is a major event. Admiring a female at Centro Manu with my partner was a perfect way to end of a year of birding in Costa Rica. Purple-throated Fruitcrow&amp;#8211; Like the Snowy Cotinga, if you go birding in the right places and know how to look for them, you should see fruitcrows. They seem to be doing especially well in forests near and south of Limon. Updating &#8220;How to See, Find, and Identify Birds in Costa Rica&#8221; An edited version of my bird finding ebook for Costa Rica was long overdue. It took a while to update it but I&amp;#8217;m glad I did; since 2015, some places have closed and lot more places have opened. This second version includes most of the new places for birding in Costa Rica along with updates for all of the older, classic locales. Updating the Costa Rica Birds Field Guide app I&amp;#8217;m also glad to have helped update the Costa Rica Birds Field Guide app with more images, new birds (a couple of birds are still added to the Costa Rica bird list every year!), and more information. To make the app as thorough as possible, more than 60 additional species that could occur are also included in this birding app for Costa Rica. Sharing Birds As always, the biggest highlight is having the chance to share so many birds in Costa Rica with my partner and many other people. I hope you...</description>

            <title>Some common birds of Shennongjia, China</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/some-common-birds-of-shennongjia-china.htm</link>
            <description>The photos in this post were taken in 2015 and 2016 &amp;#8211; I was not only an amazingly attractive, almost young person then, but also a surprisingly bad photographer. I also only managed to see rather common bird species at Shennongjia, a nature reserve in Hubei province, China. If this does not put you off from reading this post, you are hopeless anyway, so just proceed &amp;#8230; The Brown-breasted Bulbul might well be the most common bird at Shennongjia, so it seems appropriate to start with it. &amp;#160; This photo of a Buff-throated Warbler (I hope it is, anyway &amp;#8211; Bella from Alpinebirding will probably correct me in a comment if I am wrong) is remarkable for both the number of insects in the bird&amp;#8217;s bill and my amazing incapability to utilize noise reduction to smoothen the background. Fortunately, some birds like this rather wonderful Chinese Babax family with chicks let me get close enough &amp;#8211; and in decent enough light &amp;#8211; that smoothening the background was not much of an issue. &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; If you see a Collared Finchbill before it has washed its face and brushed its teeth in the morning, it looks like this. &amp;#8220;You could have waited to take the photo until I have taken my bath, couldn&amp;#8217;t you?&amp;#8221; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; (yes, I know, too many photos of this one, but I love its colors) &amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Please take me with some red objects &amp;#8211; it highlights my nice green color&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Natural reddish tones would be even nicer&amp;#8221;. My lawyer told me just to call this a Cuckoo species so there will be no lawsuits from irate birders with better bird id skills than mine. If you think this Daurian Redstart looks bad, remember how unattractive you looked at certain times when you were a teenager. Whenever the wagtails have a family gathering in somebody&amp;#8217;s home, you can usually find the Forrest Wagtail in the kitchen as this is closest to their natural forest habitat &amp;#8211; not out in the open in the living room. In the past, Great Spotted Woodpeckers mostly lived off renting out their old apartments to other species. In many Western markets, this is no longer a reliable income stream as the market has been flooded with birdhouses put up by well-meaning humans not realizing that this completely destroys the property market. Fortunately for the Great Spotted Woodpecker living in Shennongjia, this has not happened here yet. &amp;#160; The photo below shows the zygodactyl toe arrangement (two toes to the front, two to the back) useful for climbing trees &amp;#8230; &amp;#160; &amp;#8230; while this one shows how the stiff tail feathers are used as a prop against the trunk. Feeding on moths, as this Green-backed Tit does, is not particularly environmentally friendly as a large share of the moth &amp;#8211; particularly the wings &amp;#8211; is inedible and thus is just being discarded on the spot. Grey-capped Greenfinches apparently are a bit like the American population (see, e.g., &amp;#8220;The rise in positive assortative mating&amp;#8220;) and Hollywood stars in particular, in that high-quality individuals prefer to mate with each other, rather than with nobodies. This is described by two Chinese scientists who could do with somebody to help them correct their English-language papers. The finding itself is not very surprising though &amp;#8211; it would be kind of weird if socially monogamous birds of both sexes were not to try to find the highest-quality partner. Yes, it looks kind of plain. But does it deserve to be named Plain Flowerpecker? A bit of kindness in naming birds could go a long way. A male Plumbeous Water Redstart is in this weird transition phase where there are already the first stubbles of facial hair appearing but buying a razor is still a waste of money. A Red-billed Blue Magpie pretending to be a wet dog. If you ever wondered why anyone would go to the movies and watch a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, the lyrics of &amp;#8220;Inferno&amp;#8221; by the Felice Brothers provide an answer (&amp;#8220;Fight Club was sold out. We went to see Inferno instead.&amp;#8221;) I started this paragraph without having any idea how to link this song to the Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrush. I still have no idea. Ideas welcome. I frantically searched the internet for a (presumably British) naturalist/ornithologist with the surname Russet (Lord Elgar Russet?) before discovering that russet means &amp;#8220;reddish-brown in color&amp;#8221;. Takes some of the mystery out of the Russet Sparrow, I am afraid. &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; The Verditer Flycatcher has found an interesting way to avoid being parasitized by cuckoos. &#160;It feeds newly hatched chicks entirely with beetles and grasshoppers. These are poor quality and hard-to-digest diet items that are rarely fed to chicks by regular cuckoo hosts (source).&#160;Kind of like kicking the bum roommate or partner out by only preparing really bad food. As a consequence, even though the Verditer Flycatcher does not discriminate against foreign eggs, no cuckoo species has found a viable way to turn it into a useful stepparent. &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#8220;Hey, it&amp;#8217;s such a beautiful sunny day! Why don&amp;#8217;t we all go to our local pool and have a bath!&amp;#8221; (Vinous-throated Parrotbills) (there probably is one bird about one meter away from the little pool, just trying to stay away from the crowd a bit. I identify with that individual) Coming back to brood parasitism: The White-browed Laughingthrush is most likely an original host of the Large Hawk-Cuckoo. However, with time it has gotten better at rejecting eggs that do not mimic its own eggs well. The authors of this paper think that this may have led to the Large Hawk-Cuckoo partially switching to another host species, the Chinese Babax (see photos above), as this species is not as good at rejecting non-matching eggs yet (source). &amp;#160; &amp;#160; Finally, some more reading material as a reward to those who have gotten this far: &#8220;The Bear Who Let It Alone&#8221; by James Thurber.</description>

            <title>The Reptilian Interloper</title>
            <link>https://www.10000birds.com/the-reptilian-interloper.htm</link>
            <description>I would say it was just another mundane morning at the treatment ponds in SW Tobago &amp;#8211; but this wouldn&amp;#8217;t be true no matter how convenient the framing would be to set the stage for this post. Several migratory species were around &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ll touch on these in a subsequent post &amp;#8211; but all was quiet and calm nevertheless. Ducks and grebes paddled around, Anhingas swam beneath the surface, occasionally appearing with a skewered fish. A Black Skimmer drifted from one end of the pond to the other, oftentimes coming into such proximity that the swishing of its feathers was audible. I had been visiting the ponds for the ducks, but stayed for the general ambience. An Anhinga tosses her freshly caught breakfast. Black Skimmer Two immature Least Grebes approach an adult, asking kindly for a snack. After about an hour, I noticed an unfamiliar presence: a Spectacled Caiman! These small crocodilians pose no threat to humans, but I had never before seen one in these ponds. Sure enough, I wondered about their presence as there was ample food available &amp;#8211; fish and aquatic invertebrates &amp;#8211; but hadn&amp;#8217;t seen one up until this particular morning. As the caiman blinked its eyes and lay motionless in the water, it became apparent that I wasn&amp;#8217;t the only one surprised by its presence. A Least Grebe began a tentative approach, its bright yellow eyes affixed on the caiman. Slowly, it got closer. And closer. Was it going to waltz into becoming breakfast? Maybe the grebe had never seen a Spectacled Caiman before? Perhaps the bird was trying to get a closer view, so as to reference the images of possible threats it learned as a young bird? Oh, how the things you learn in school very rapidly vaporize once adulthood sets in&amp;#8230; My assessment of the situation was that the grebe made a very ideal-sized meal for the caiman. It seemed as if it was almost the perfect size. As I was pondering this, making the calculations of caiman jaw size versus grebe roundness &amp;#8211; the bird suddenly panicked, as humans do when they bump into something unfamiliar in the dark. As comical as it was, the caiman didn&amp;#8217;t seem too amused by the whole thing, and began to lazily swim off toward the other end of the pond. Which attracted more attention from the twenty-or-so Least Grebes in the pond. Adults and juveniles all surrounded the beast, while keeping a respectable distance. Eventually the caiman disappeared and equilibrium was restored. I spoke with some other birders who also remarked on seeing the caiman for the first time. Did I witness the initiation of the caiman into life in this treatment pond? I&amp;#8217;ve seen the species mentioned here happily coexisting in other places, so I didn&amp;#8217;t expect curiosity from either party. But nature continues to emphasize the point that species are not individuals.</description>
